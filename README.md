HR Analytics Dashboard!

The Dataset was of employees of a company, where the requirement was to make a dynamic dashboard for the HR, to understand employees of various departments. The data was raw carrying null values, irrelevant columns, and rows.

So from cleaning the data to fixing the null values, I did it in Excel and then exported it to PowerBi. Where I find some valuable insights like:

* Attrition Rate Analysis: Gain a deep understanding of how employees leave the company, enabling us to identify retention challenges and implement effective strategies.

* Employee Age Group Distribution: Get valuable insights into the distribution of employees across various age groups, facilitating strategic workforce planning and personalized development programs.

* Job Satisfaction Rating by Role: Evaluate job satisfaction levels across different job roles, providing valuable insights to improve engagement and tailor initiatives for enhanced employee satisfaction.

In conclusion, our HR analytics dashboard provides valuable insights that enable data-driven decision-making for driving organizational success
